Paul Cohn waved goodbye to his parents when he boarded the train on 21 May 1939; he would never see his parents again. Paul Cohn was prepared for the news when he learned of his parents' death after the war. This book extends the lecture notes Skew field constructions published in 1977 but the 1995 work provides a comprehensive look at the whole area:  https :    mathsh istory.st andrews .ac .uk  B iograph ies  Cohn   Page 3 sur 5 Pau l Cohn (1924   2006)   B iography   MacTutor H istory of Mathemat ics 2021 05 11 18:39 The theory of skew fields is still not so familiar as the commutative analogue. Paul Cohn was a loving family man who never forgot his background in Germany and who always remembered his parents' sacrifice and devotion in sending him by Kindertransport to England.
